🧠 Data Science Learning Portfolio
📌 Overview
Welcome to my personal data science learning portfolio. This repository is a collection of hands-on projects I've worked on to build and strengthen my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and related fields. Each project reflects a new concept I've learned, a technique I’ve practiced, or an area of data science I've explored in more depth.
Rather than being production-ready applications, these projects are meant as learning milestones—demonstrating my growth over time, experimentation with tools, and understanding of the full data science pipeline.
🎯 Purpose
The main goals of this portfolio are to:
Track and showcase my learning progress in data science
Apply theoretical knowledge to practical, real-world problems
Build intuition with data manipulation, modeling, and evaluation
Explore different tools, libraries, and workflows
Document what I’ve learned for future reference
This is my sandbox for continuous improvement and experimentation.
🔍 Topics Covered
The projects in this portfolio span across multiple areas in data science, including:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Supervised Learning: Classification & regression
Unsupervised Learning: Clustering, anomaly detection
Natural Language Processing (NLP)
Time Series Forecasting
Model Evaluation & Tuning
Basic Deployment & Visualization: Streamlit, Dash
Each project focuses on applying different techniques and solving problems with real datasets.
🧰 Tools & Technologies
Some of the tools and libraries I’ve used so far include:
Python, Jupyter Notebooks
Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
TensorFlow, Keras, XGBoost
NLTK, spaCy (for NLP)
Statsmodels, Prophet (for time series)
Streamlit, Flask (for experimentation with deployment)
🚀 How to Use
Each folder contains a standalone project with its own README, outlining:
What I set out to learn or build
The dataset used
Steps taken (EDA, preprocessing, modeling, evaluation)
What I learned or found challenging
Ideas for improvement
Feel free to explore the folders to follow my learning path.
