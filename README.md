# 🧠 Data Science Learning Portfolio

## 📌 Overview
Welcome to my personal data science learning portfolio. This repository is a collection of hands-on projects I've worked on to build and strengthen my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and related fields. Each project reflects a new concept I've learned, a technique I’ve practiced, or an area of data science I've explored in more depth.

Rather than being production-ready applications, these projects are meant as learning milestones—demonstrating my growth over time, experimentation with tools, and understanding of the full data science pipeline.

---

## 🎯 Purpose
- Track and showcase my learning progress in data science
- Apply theoretical knowledge to practical, real-world problems
- Build intuition with data manipulation, modeling, and evaluation
- Explore different tools, libraries, and workflows
- Document what I’ve learned for future reference

This is my sandbox for continuous improvement and experimentation.

## 🔍 Topics Covered
Projects in this portfolio span multiple areas, including:
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- **Supervised Learning:** Classification & Regression
- **Unsupervised Learning:** Clustering, Anomaly Detection
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
- **Time Series Forecasting**
- **Model Evaluation & Tuning**
- **Basic Deployment & Visualization:** Streamlit, Dash

Each project applies different techniques and solves problems with real datasets.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
Some of the tools and libraries I’ve used:
- Python, Jupyter Notebooks
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- TensorFlow, Keras, XGBoost
- NLTK, spaCy (for NLP)
- Statsmodels, Prophet (for time series)
- Streamlit, Flask (for deployment experimentation)

## 🚀 How to Use
Each folder contains a standalone project with its own README, outlining:
- Project goals and objectives
- Dataset used
- Steps taken (EDA, preprocessing, modeling, evaluation)
- Key learnings and challenges
- Ideas for improvement

Feel free to explore the folders to follow my learning path.
